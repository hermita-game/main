# Website

The website is a submodule in the git tree. [(see)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

Note that when you clone the main game repository, you will need to use the --recursive flag to also clone the submodule repositories. You can also update the submodule to the latest commit by navigating to the submodule directory and running git pull.
